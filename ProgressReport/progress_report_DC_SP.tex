    \section{Problem Statement}

    Something about knowledge discovery for chess. People want games to study, but don't want all the boring standard stuff.

    \section{Problem Analysis}

    Probably some statements from the paper we found.

    \section{Literature Review}

    Find some stuff about changing the piece values.

    \section{Subproblems, Statement and Analysis}

    We can probably mention that we plan on possibly going above and beyond, which is why we have the above and beyond piece 
    values as a subproblem.

    \section{Algorithmic Sketch, Illustration of Solution}

    Not sure what we would do here, but we can probably draw something pretty quick in paint (or figure out how to do graphs in 
    \LaTeX) as our sketch.
